## Browser, Editor and Terminal Setup
Check out here [what Wes Bos is using as software and hardware](https://wesbos.com/uses).

#### Which browser to use
Chrome on MAC

#### Dev Tools
Learn these few shortcuts!
- `cmd option i` dev tools where you last left them
- `cmd shift c` inspect elements
- `cmd option j` JavaScript console
- `cmd option u` view source in new tab

#### IDE
- Visual Studio Code (in terms of tooling for JavaScript Wes Bos recommends VSC)

#### nodejs and npm
- run `node -v` in your terminal to check if you have node installed (at time of writing I'm using node version v15.7.0)
    - no node? [see nodejs website for download](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- run `npm -v` in your terminal to check if you have npm installed (at time of writing I'm ussing npm version 7.4.3)
    - no npm? first install node, [npm is coming with it](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- run `node` in your terminal to get into the node environment
    - node.js is JavaScript that can run on the server
    - inputs are executed and results are returned
    - run `ctrl c` to exit the node environment

#### Commandline Basics
- `cd` change directory
- `cd ..` go up a level
- `ls -l` list out everything that's in the current directory
- `pwd` "print work directory", if you ever want to know where you are
- `cmd k` to clear the terminal window

#### Relative Path
- `./` means IN the same folder
- `../` means go up one level

## Running and Loading JS
- you can run JavaScript in various ways:
    - within the Browser console (in Dev Tools)
    - with node in terminal
    - via `<script>` tag in HTML file: `<script src="./some.js" async defer></script>`
        - refers to an external js file on the same level
        - if you put the `<script>` tag in the `<head>` please mind, that the **script will have run (end ended!) before the** `<body>` **tag is rendered**, so whatever's in the `<body>` can't be addressed via JavaScript!
        - put the `<script>` tag always **right before** your closing `<body>` tag to make sure that everything you want to address (as elements etc.) has already been rendered!
        - `async defer` will delay the actual running of the JavaScript; will download the js file asyncronously and will run it once the HTML has been loaded on the page
    - of course you can have multiple `<script>` tags within `<body>` but please be aware that every js file needs to be downloaded and loaded so this can be VERY inefficient

## Variables and Statements
- different types of variables: **var**, **let** and **const**

```
var name = 'Nike';
let age = 300;
const alive = true;
```

- `var` and `let` can be updated, their values can be re-assigned
- `const` values can not be changed (not totally true, wait for chapter Arrays and Objects)

```
// do NOT re-declare variables as follows
// (bad practice, in modules it won't even work)

var name = 'Nike';
let age = 300;
const alive = true;

// NOPE!:
var name = 'new Nikelette';
```

- strict mode `use strict;`
    - results from old-ish JavaScript where people simply declared variables as follows `dog = 'Boomer';`
    - it wasnâ€™t clear if it's a `var`, `let` or `const` so `use strict;` was introduced to force people to properly declare their variables
    - obviously, old code still needs to be supported so we cannot set `use strict;` for EVERYTHING, as this would break the older JS BUT we can introduce it for code we create from scratch
    - `use strict;` is enforced anyhow by default when you use JavaScript modules (and JavaScript modules is probably how you are going to write all of your modern JavaScript)

- semicolons `;` yes or no?
    - probably yes, especially if you work in more than one language
    - end your JavaScript statements with `;`
    - in my case, enabling Prettier for my VSCode environment automatically omits `;` (so I assume omitting them generally is ok...); I've disabled Prettier and returned to VSCode's built-in JavaScript formatter (and use `;` for the time being tho)
    - ASI - Automatic Semicolon Insertion Rules - to check out later when more JavaScript knowledge has been gained

- scoping
    - where are my variables available to **me**
    - `var` is differently scoped than `let` and `const`
    - `var` is function scoped (only available inside the parent function)
    - `let`, `const` are block scoped
    - `let` and `const` became available with ES6
    - Wes Bos always uses `const` per default, as he approaches this, never knowing if he will need to update that variable, his default here is "no update"

- naming conventions
    - variable names should NOT start with a capital letter UNLESS THEY ARE A CLASS
    - allowed: `A` to `Z`, `a` to `z`, `_` (comes from lowdash), `$` (comes from jQuery)
    - dashes (kebab case) are not allowed in JavaScript, so this is NOT allowed: `this-is-not-allowed`, even though dashes are allowed in CSS selectors
    - camel case: `useCamelCaseForVariableNames` for variable names
    - upper camel case: `UpperCamelCaseForClass` if you are building a class
    - snake case: `this_is_snake_case`

## Code Quality Tooling with Prettier and ESLint
- [ESLint demo/tryout page](https://eslint.org/demo)
    - JavaScript linter tool for identifying potential issues
    - you can have different plug-ins for ESLint (e.g., a vue plug-in, react plug-in, etc.)
- [Prettier playground](https://prettier.io/playground/)
    - Prettier is entirely for formatting code and somewhat opinionated
- [Wes Bos shared ESLint set-up on GitHub](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos)
    - look at that GitHub page
    - [in his course video](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5de40411a0fbbc5276b7317a/view/375475807) he goes through the process of setting up his ESLint configuration, from min 07:30 on
    - he's not doing Prettier through the Prettier plug-in but doing Prettier through the ESLint plug-in
    - I did not configure my set-up his way; VSCode already includes some features I will first check out while coding along to his courses

## Types Introduction
- every time you have a value it will fall into one of the 7 types
- `SNOB'N'US` (ðŸ¤“  memory hook)
    - String
    - Number
    - Object
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
    - Symbol

## Type String
- 3 "kinds" of strings:
```
'single quotes'
"double quotes"
`back ticks`
```
- escaping a character: `const sentence = "she's so \"cool\"";`

- with the use of back ticks:
    - you don't need to escape characters
    - interpolation and concatenation
    - maintenance of blank lines
```
const sentence3 = `she's so "cool"`;
```
```
const song = `
    Oh

    yeah

    I like

    pizza
`;
```
```
// concatenation and interpolation without back ticks

const hello = 'Hello my name is ' + prename + '. Nice to meet you';
```
- using a `+` within a string concatenates all to a string

```
// concatenation and interpolation with back ticks

const hello2 = `Hello my name is ${prename} . Nice to meet you`;
```
- pop a variable inside of a string with `${variable}`

## Type Number
- there's only one type of number in JavaScript which is "number"
- the use `typeof` + variable or number will tell you the type
```
const age = 300;
const nickname = 'horst';
typeof age; // "number"
typeof nickname; // "string"
```
```
// both are `typeof "number"`

const integ = 200; // whole number
const floatN = 100.25; // number that has a decimal
```
- `+ - x /` operators are available on numbers
```
// be aware when you are mixing types, type conversion might happen, concatenation

1 + "1" // "11"
```

- helper methods:
    - run `Math.` in the browser's JavaScript console
        - there's tons of helper methods you can use for doing math
    - most important ones might be:
        - `Math.round()`, values you put as parameter will be rounded up or down
        - `Math.floor()`, values you put as parameter will give you the lower end
        - `Math.ceil()`, value you put as parameter will give you the upper one
        - `Math.random()`, you don't need to put a parameter here as this returns a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)

**Modulo:**
- how many is left after something has been split up evenly
```
const smarties = 20;
const kids = 3;
const eachKidGets = smarties / kids;
console.log(`Each kid gets ${eachKidGets} smarties`); // Each kid gets 6.666666666666667 smarties
const left = smarties % kids;
console.log(`show me what's left: ${left}`);
```

**Floating-Point:**
```
const floatP = 0.1 + 0.2;
console.log('floating-point here: ', floatP); // 0.30000000000000004

```
- [floating point explained](https://0.30000000000000004.com/)

**Infinity / -Infinity:**
```
1000 ** 200; // Infinity
typeof Infinity // "number"
typeof -Infinity // "number"
```
- dealing with numbers that are too high to be calculated by computers

**NaN - Not a Number:**
```
10 / 'dog'; // NaN
typeof NaN; // "number"
```

## Type Object
- everything in JavaScript is an object
- collection of data / functionality
- group things together
```
const person = {
    first: 'wes',
    last: 'bos',
    age: 300
};
console.table(person);
console.table(typeof(person)); // object
console.log(person.first); // wes
console.log(person.last); // bos
console.log(person.age); // 300
```
- order of property-value-pairs doesn't matter in an object, when you need something where order matters use an array
- access values with dot notation

## Type Symbol
- a way to do unique properties / unique identifiers
- more details later in the course

## Type Null and Undefined
**null and undefined**
- a way to express "nothing" in JavaScript
- both express "nothing" in JavaScript, but in different ways

**undefined**

- a value that not yet has a value set, hasn't assigned anything to it:
```
let home; // undefined
```
- if you try to access a variable which has been created but not set:
```
let dog;
console.log(dog); // undefined
```

**null**

- has no value set to it:
```
let somethingUndefined; // undefined
```
- has the value of null ("nothing") explicitly set:
```
let somethingNull = null; // null
```

## Type Boolean and Equality
- true or false
- on or off
- used for logic like if statements
- used for calculation
```
let age2 = 18;
const ofAge = age2 > 19;
console.log(ofAge); // false
age2 = 400;
console.log(age2); // 400
```

- `=` only for setting / assigning / updating a value of a variable
- `===`, `==` almost always use `===`
```
10 === 10 // true -> will check for value AND type
10 == 10 // true -> will check for value
"10" == 10 // true, only checks for value NOT type
"10" === 10 // false, different types
```
